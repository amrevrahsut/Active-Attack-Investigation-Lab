# SOC Lab: Active Attack Simulation & Forensic Investigation

## 🛡️ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of a cyberattack—from execution to detection. I simulated an active attack from a **Kali Linux** machine against a **Windows 10 VM** and performed a forensic investigation using **Windows Event Logs** and **Sysmon** to identify the adversary's footprints.



## 🛠️ Lab Environment
* **Attacker:** Kali Linux (VMware)
* **Target:** Windows 10 x64 (Hardened with Sysmon)
* **Focus:** Credential Access / Execution / Persistence.

## ⚔️ Attack Phase (Kali Linux)
In this phase, I simulated an adversary attempting to compromise the Windows target.

### 1. The Attack: [Insert Attack Name, e.g., Brute Force / Malicious Script]
* **Tool Used:** [e.g., Hydra, Metasploit, or PowerShell]
* **Action:** Executed a simulated attack targeting [e.g., RDP/SMB or a specific process].
* **Goal:** To generate high-fidelity telemetry in the system logs for analysis.

## 🛡️ Forensic Investigation (Windows 10)
After the attack, I acted as a **SOC Analyst** to hunt for the logs generated by the activity.

### 1. Identifying Authentication Failures (Event ID 4625)
By filtering the Security Logs, I identified a massive spike in failed logon attempts.
* **Source IP:** [Attacker_IP_Sanitized]
* **Target Account:** Administrator
* **Analyst Note:** The high frequency of these events confirmed a Brute Force attack pattern.

### 2. Process Tracking with Sysmon (Event ID 1)
I used **Sysmon** to track malicious process creation that standard logs might miss.
* **Detection:** Identified an unusual process `[Malicious_Process].exe` spawning from `cmd.exe`.
* **Parent/Child Correlation:** Verified the parent process was an unauthorized shell.

## 📊 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
| Tactic | Technique | ID | Log Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Credential Access** | Brute Force | T1110 | Security Log (4625) |
| **Execution** | Command & Scripting Interpreter | T1059 | Sysmon (Event ID 1) |

## 🚀 Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Threat Hunting:** Manually searching through thousands of logs to find specific attack signatures.
* **Sysmon Integration:** Utilizing advanced telemetry for process tree analysis.
* **Adversary Simulation:** Understanding the attacker mindset to better configure defensive alerts.
